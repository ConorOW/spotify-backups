# Spotify Backups

I hate using Spotify because it gives me access to all the music in the world but the artists who make it dont get reimbursed.  

I also read an article which said Spotify had "*spawned a new type of music listener, one who thinks less about the artist or album they are seeking out, and instead connects with emotions, moods and activities, where they just pick a playlist and let it roll.*" I can relate to that, so I used this script to get a recording of everything ive saved, and now will spend more time buying records, going to concerts and properly supporting artists!
